## HW-setup
The software was designed to operate in "duplicate-screen"-setup, so that the operator sees the same as the audience. 

## Configuration
On first start or by navigating to the setting menu (gear icon in bottom-left corner), the configuration dialogue is opened.

## Operating
A brief usage description is included in the menu. Points are assigned via mouse control, but there are also various shortcuts to control clocks, etc.

## Webserver interface
There exists an interface to import live JSON data to display names and group/ round information from a third party webserver / database.

## Own bell / horn / audio samples
Own audio files can be added in base64 embedded form <audio id="sound[n]" src="data:audio/ogg;base64,...>

## Licence
Free usage and modification for non-commercial use.
